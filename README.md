# Exposis: Regression Model Comparison

This project explores various regression techniques, comparing their performance on a given dataset. The models include both linear and non-linear approaches, offering insights into their effectiveness for different data patterns.

## Features

- **Implemented Regression Models**:
  1. Linear Regression
  2. Gradient Boosting Regressor
  3. Random Forest Regressor
  4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  5. Bayesian Regression
  6. Polynomial Regression

- **Predict Profit**:
  - Predict the profit value of a company based on its R&D spend, administration cost, and marketing spend using a dataset of 50 companies.

- **Performance Comparison**:
  - Evaluate models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ² Score, and more.

- **Visualization**:
  - Includes plots to visualize the regression fit and model performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For implementing the models.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For regression algorithms and metrics.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Google Colab**: For running the notebook interactively.
